I would like a HTML, Python, Flask App
	- in it's own venv
	- has it's own routes file
	
Main html page:
	- imports a html file (file selector).  Example:  All_Players.html
	- has a dropdown to select a position (loads from All_Players.html column 'Position').
	- has two dropdowns to compare two stats (loads from All_Players.html columns from Aer A/90 to the xG column)
	- has a button to 'compare' that is disabled until all values have been selected

When compare button is clicked:
	- values are filtered on their selected dropdowns
	- a football stats style x,y graph is displayed on the page with central x and y axis drawn based on the average of the x and y values
